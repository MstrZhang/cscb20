### NOTE

For this week's lab, you will need your own computer. It is **not possible** to install Flask on the lab computers and there currently isn't a solution to run your code in the lab. If you do not have your own computer or did not bring your own computer this week, consider working with a partner for this week's lab

### Introduction to Flask

Flask is described as "microframework" for Python. It consists of a collection of tools that help to aid the web development process and alleviate many of the hardships of vanilla web development.

Flask is fairly easy to install on Python using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) the package manager for Python. `pip` should come preinstalled with Python if you are using Python 2 >= 2.79 (not recommended) or Python 3 >= 3.4 (recommended) however if you do not have it installed (i.e. running `pip` encounters an error), you can install it manually.

The easiest way to install `pip` if you do not have it is to re-install Python with the newest version (version 3.7 at the time of writing). I highly recommend you try to do this first because the installation process is pretty convoluted on most platforms. You can do so by downloading the latest version of Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). After the installation, you should have `pip` installed. If you still do not have `pip` installed, try the following:

**Windows Instructions**:
- Download the `get-pip.py` file from [here](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py)
    - This should open a bunch of text. Right click on the page and click **Save As** to save the file. Save it somewhere easily accessible
- On **Command Prompt**, navigate to the folder where you saved `get-pip.py`
    - The change directory command on Windows is `dir`. It operates the same as `cd` on a UNIX-based computer
    - You can *sometimes* right-click on the current directory to open a command prompt to avoid changing directories through Command Prompt (however this usually does not work unless you've explicitly enabled it)
- Run `python get-pip.py` to install `pip`
- Run `python -m pip install -U pip` to upgrade to the latest version

**Mac / Linux Instructions**:
- Run the following two commands:
    - `sudo python -m ensurepip`
    - `sudo pip install -U pip`

**IMPORTANT NOTE**:
- **`pip` cannot be installed on the lab computers as it requires higher-level privileges. It is highly suggested at this point forward that you use your personal computer. Doing any of the preceding instructions on a lab computer WILL NOT WORK**

If you are still struggling to install `pip` at this point please ask a TA for help

When you have `pip` installed, installing Flask is very easy. On any platform, run the following command: `pip install Flask`
- If you are on Mac or Linux and this doesn't work, try `sudo pip install Flask` instead

Outside of Flask, `pip` is very useful as it gives you the power to download and install many potentially useful packages that you might choose to use later on

### Starting a Flask app

A basic Flask app is structured as follows:

```
/home/my-flask-app/
|___ app.py
|___ templates/
     |___ base.html
|___ static/
     |___ style.css
```

Where `/home/my-flask-app` would be the directory of your Flask application

The file `app.py` is your "main" file and is what runs the app. In order to start you application, you can run `python app.py` or `python3 app.py` depending on your Python version. This will open up your application at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

The two main directories to focus on are the following:
- `templates/`
    - This folder contains all the HTML templates for what you will serve to the browser (i.e. what the user will see)
    - Flask expects HTML files to be in a folder called `templates/` so ensure your folder is named appropriately
        - If this is named improperly, `render_template()` will not work
- `static/`
    - This folder contains all of the static, non-changing elements of the site (i.e. such as the CSS / JavaScript)
    - If you choose to write CSS, you would place it in this folder
        - We will not focus on CSS in this lab

Your basic barebones `app.py` file will looks as follows:

```python
# required imports; you may add more in the future; currently, we will only use render_template
from flask import Flask, render_template

# tells Flask that "this" is the current running app
app = Flask(__name__)

# setup the default route
# this is the page the site will load by default (i.e. like the home page)
@app.route('/')
def root():
    # tells Flask to render the HTML page called index.html
    return render_template('index.html')

# run the app when app.py is run
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

### Getting Input From a Form

Flask can send data to `app.py` from the browser (i.e. from the HTML page) using something called an **HTTP request**. The exact details of the request will be discussed later in lecture. In order to receive data from the web page, Flask receives a `GET` request from a `<form></form>` block whenever the user press the corresponding `<input type="submit"></input>` button. A block in a webpage that can send input to Flask looks as follows:

```html
<form action="/add-comment">
    <input type="text" name="comment-input" placeholder="enter a new comment">
    <input type="submit" name="comment-submit" value="submit">
</form>
```

**NOTE: the GET request is not supposed to be used to modify data (this is a violation of the standard); don't worry about this for now but in a later lab we will improve this example by refactoring this**

Flask automatically sends a `GET` request to the **endpoint** provided in the `action` attribute inside the `<form></form>` tag. We can catch this particular endpoint in `app.py` by specifying it using `app.route('/add-comment')` or substituting `/add-comment` for any other endpoint you may decide to use. 

To get the input the user has submitted, we make use of a module of Flask called `requests`. `requests` searches for any `<input></input>` tags inside the corresponding `<form></form>` tags and captures these values. To access them, in `app.py` we can using `request.args.get('comment-input')` as follows:

```python
@app.route('/add-comment')
def add_comment():
    global comments
    comments.append(request.args.get('comment-input')
    ...
```

The `request.args.get()` command returns the value inside the input that matches the `name` attribute inside the `<input></input>` tags. Notice how `comment-input` matches the corresponding value in the HTML code

Additionally, notice how the variable `comments` is referred to using the `global` keyword. This is Python syntax for creating a global variable for the comments outside of the `add_comment()` function (you will see this in the starter code). Generally, this practice of using global variables is **not recommended** but we will refactor this later when we'll use an SQLite database instead of a global variable

To use send data from Flask to the browser, we can pass in additional parameters to the `render_template()` function. Consider the sample code from Abbas's `app.py` (from Quercus -- Week 5 material):

```python
@app.route('/')
def root():
    return render_template('home.html',data=posts, title="abbas")
```

The browser is now able to access these variables using the keys they were given (e.g. the key `data` will return the `posts` list and the key `title` will return the string `abbas`)

### Tutorial Exercise

Your task for this week's tutorial is to make a TODO list. The TODO list will have an input for and a button. Upon providing input and pressing the button, the page will display the user's input in a table below. Download the sample code for this exercise [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/res/week6-lab.zip)

The provided sample code is in the following structure:

```
/week6-lab/
|___ app.py
|___ templates/
     |___ index.html
|___ static/
     |___ style.css
```

In summary, your tasks are as follows:

1. Complete `app.py`
    - Finish the appropriate routing
    - Complete the TODO logic
        - i.e. when a user inputs a TODO, the table updates appropriately
        - Complete the areas specified in the comments
2. Complete `index.html`
    - Complete the areas specified in the comments
3. **BONUS**: look at and consider extending the file `styles.css`

The end result should look something like this:

<div style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid grey; padding: 15px;">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/week06.png">
</div>
<br>

Some tips before you get started:

- Write your code in Visual Studio Code. It will make your life much easier when it comes to writing HTML code
- Make sure that your attributes are named correctly
    - If you are trying to use `request.args.get()`, ensure that your input tags have the `name` attribute with the matching name
    - Make sure `app.route()` matches the `action` attribute in the form tags
- Make sure that you have the correct directory structure
    - Do not modify the directory structure of the starter code, it should be sufficient for this week's exercise
