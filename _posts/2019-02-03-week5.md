excerpt: Wrapping up SQL with views and GROUP BY clauses. A brief introduction to HTML and CSS
---

### Views

A **view** is a result set of a stored query. Think of it as a subset of a table or a snapshot (i.e. a _view_) into a table.

Views have several advantage**s** in the real world:

- A view can hide certain columns from a table. This is useful if you want want users to see certain columns but not others (e.g. employees should be able to see each others' phone numbers but not their salaries)
- Can provide time savings in writing queries by having a group of frequently accessed tables joined together in a view
- Provide more ways to manipulate data and easily get the information you are looking for

The syntax to create a view in SQLite is as follows:

```SQL
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
    SELECT columns
    FROM tables
    [WHERE conditions];
```

Notice how the view is ess**e**ntially a SELECT statement on a pre-existing table

For the following exercises, we will be using this [database]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/res/worksheet5.db). We will be using the `employees` relation. You can see the schema of this relation using the SQLite browser or the command `.schema employees`

Exercises:

1. Create a view called `Calgary_Employees` of all employees whose city is `Calgary`
2. Create a view called `Managers` of all employees who are some sort of manager
    - To find a title containing the word "Manager", you can use the `LIKE` keyword: `SELECT * FROM table WHERE column LIKE '%string%'`
3. Create a view called `Small_Employee` that is the same as the `Employee` table but only contains the following **c**olumns:
    - `EmployeeId`
    - `FirstName`
    - `LastName`
    - `Title`
    - `Phone`
    - `Email`

### `GROUP BY`

`GROUP BY` is an optional clause in the `SELECT` statement that returns one row for each group. For each group, you can apply an *aggregate function* (such as `MIN`, `MAX`, `SUM`, `COUNT`, or `AVG`) to provide more information about each group

The syntax for a sample `GROUP BY` clause is as follows:

```SQL
SELECT
    column_1,
    aggregate_function(column_2)
FROM
    table
GROUP BY
    column_1,
    column_2;
```

The `GROUP BY` clause has an optional keyword `HAVING` that allows you to filter for a condition for a group or an aggregate. A typical example is filte**r**ing a `COUNT()` operation using something like  `... HAVING COUNT(column) < 15` An example is as follows:

```SQL
SELECT
    column_1,
    aggregate_function (column_2)
FROM
    table
GROUP_BY
    column_1
HAVING
    search_condition;
```

For the following exercises, we will use the above mentioned database file but we will use the `tracks` and `albums` relations instead. You can see the schemas of these relations using the SQLit**e** browser or the commands `.schema tracks` and `.schema albums`

Exercises:

1. Return the result set containing the album ID and number of tracks per album for every album ID in the relation
2. Do the same as above but order the groups in descending order
    - You can do this using the `ORDER BY` clause and the `DESC` parameter
3. Do the same as above but include the album **t**itle as well
    - HINT: you will have to do an `INNER JOIN`
4. Do the same as above but only return records where `trackid > 15`

### HTML

HTML stands for **HyperText Markup Language**. It is a formatting system used by browsers to render the webpages we see on the internet

There is no "one" program to write HTML in so it is suggested you use some sort of text editor. I recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) which comes pre-installed on the lab computers for you to use.

HTML code is made up of elements called **tags** that denote the structure of a webpage. A basic HTML web page looks as follows:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>My Website</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>This is a paragraph</p>
    </body>
</html>
```

A basic description of the above tags:

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: this is here for legacy reasons; it mostly does nothing but when omitted some old browsers use a rendering mode that is incompatible with some specifications; although it appears useless, it is necessary for any HTML file you produce
- `<html>`: tells the browser this is an HTML document; its the container for all the other HTML elements (except the `<!DOCTYPE>` tag)
- `<head>`: container for all the head elements (i.e. scripts, styles, meta information, ...)
- `<title>`: the name of the website; this will be shown in the "tab" on your browser
- `<body>`: the meat and potatoes of the website; this is where you will put all the "visual" elements
- `<p>`: a paragraph tag; indicates that you are writing a paragraph

Some basic tags that you will use for this exercise include:

- Headings:
    - Range from `<h1>` to `<h6>`; generally used for titles
    - Example: `<h1>keviniscool</h1>`
- Anchor:
    - Link to other HTML pages or websites
    - Example: `<a href="https://www.google.ca">this is a link</a>`
- Images:
    - Display an image
    - Example: `<img src="dog.jpg" alt="this is a dog", width="420" height="69" />`
- Lists:
    - There are two types of lists denoted by the outside tags
        - The inner tags `<li>` are the list items

```html
<!-- this is an unordered list; it will be displayed with bullets -->
<ul>
    <li>kevin</li>
    <li>is</li>
    <li>cool</li>
</ul>

<!-- this is an ordered list; it will be displayed with numbers -->
<ol>
    <li>kevin</li>
    <li>is</li>
    <li>cool</li>
<ol>
```

Some tags contain information inside the leading tag (the first tag) called **attributes**. Some tags don't have any attributes at all and some have a range of varying optional attributes. You do not have to remember all attributes however you should remember some of the main ones (e.g. attributes of `<img>` and `<a>`). If you need to find the attribute of a given tag, you should use Google

HTML contains structures called **tables** used for organizing information. An example table is defined as follows:

```html
<table>                             <!-- the table tag indicates a table being created -->
  <tr>                              <!-- indicates a table row -->
    <th>Firstname</th>              <!-- th indicates a table header; it will be bolded -->
    <th>Lastname</th> 
    <th>Age</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Jill</td>                   <!-- td indicates table data; it will not be bolded -->
    <td>Smith</td> 
    <td>50</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Eve</td>
    <td>Jackson</td> 
    <td>94</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

Exercise:

Make a small "blog" page about yourself. The blog must contain the following components:

1. A title at the top with the name of your blog
2. An image to represent your blog (can be anything; doesn't have to be of yourself)
3. A table containing the following information:
    - Your first name
    - Your last name
    - A motto to describe yourself
4. A paragraph with your favourite quote
5. A list of your favourite foods
6. OPTIONAL: style your website using the `style` attribute (we will discuss CSS next tutorial; if you know CSS already, feel free to decorate your blog however you'd like)

In the end, it should look something like this:

<div style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid grey; padding: 15px;">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/week05.png">
</div>
<br>

Feel free to add more to your blog to personalize it how you see fit

### Note

HTML (and web development in general) is mostly learned through a "do-and-search" ideology. What this means is that you will mostly imagine something you wish to accomplish, search it up on Google, and look for people who have done what you're looking for to complete your goal. Make sure to use Google and your TAs as resources to help you when you need help
